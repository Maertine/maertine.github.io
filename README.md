## Projects

### Risk-Return Optimization: Implementing Markowitz Portfolio Models on Nasdaq-100
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Maertine/PersonalPortfolio/tree/main/MarkowitzModels-Nasdaq100)

Developed a comprehensive portfolio optimization strategy based on the Markowitz model with historical stock data from the Nasdaq-100 index, implemented in Python. The project involved rediscovering the theory behind the model through advanced mathematical optimization techniques, without relying on imported formulae.The approach included both fixed-return and fixed-risk portfolios, employing various reweighting strategies, comparing them to traditional benchmarks like equal-weighted and tangency portfolios. Results revealed the limitations of the Markowitz model and suggested improvements, such as using geometric means for return estimation and adjusting covariance calculations. This project provides insights into portfolio selection, highlighting the critical process of adjusting for risk and return while challenging and refining model assumptions.
